Anyone can contribute to this project whatever he wants to.
 we will always try to see all pull requests from the perspective of contributor,so anybody could fork,improve and pull request without hesitation regardless of experience level.
 this project is mainly for those who are new to javascript & html (like me) but we will be obiviously glad to get help from someone experinced .
As of today-01/08/2020 
probability.js file demands some work;(e.g. how to get 8,4 from prompt instead of "8,4" )
index.html seems fine unless you've to implement something new(like give a heading to our page),and
probability.css is almost empty so there's a scope of decoration for those who are capable and willing to do so.
__________Wish you a wonderful experience contributing to this project.
