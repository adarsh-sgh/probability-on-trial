# Probability-on-trial
Let's put probability on trial by simulating trials and recording success % and comparing it with expectations from probability(favourable/total)
This is a simple and straightforward app to do experiments like throwing a dice or flipping a coin multiple times and record result. 
The app will calculate success  percentage and success count . So now you could see do you really get head(tail) 50% of the time as predicted by probability. ðŸ˜Š
